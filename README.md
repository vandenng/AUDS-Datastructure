# AUDS-Datastructure

This is an AUDS(Almost Useless Data Structure). An AUDS will hold any type of object,
through the use of the class template. This data structure will return a random
item from the list. The initial size is set to 100, and everytime the AUDS gets resized,
it will resize by 50% more than the current size of AUDS.
